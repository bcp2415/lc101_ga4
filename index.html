    <h2>Teacher</h2>

    <p>
      I stumbled into a job as a high school Latin teacher. It turned out to be
      fun.

    <p>
      After a few years I realized I wasn't learning as much as I had at the
      beginning. I got restless and decided I needed a Ph.D. in Philosophy. It
      was obvious.

    <p>In graduate school, I learned to write my papers using</p>

    <p>This was my first step into coding.</p>

    <p>
      My philosophy career led to a post-doc in Oxford. This was a lot of fun:
      no end of challenge and learning. I published a few papers and gave a few
      talks.

    <p>
      Then it was time to re-job. I returned to teaching Latin. After being
      spoiled in Oxford, I was no longer willing to take temporary jobs. This is
      typically part of the entry price to the field, and entails moving across
      the country or around the world every year.

      I found more to learn in the new Latin job, and wonderful colleagues. But
      my learning again declined over time, and I miss having a challenge. I've
      been studying basic web development technologies for the past couple of
      years, and hope to change careers in 2022.
