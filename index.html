    <h2>Teacher</h2>

    <p>
      I stumbled into a job as a high school Latin teacher. It turned out to be
      fun.

    <p>
      After a few years I realized I wasn't learning as much as I had at the
      beginning. I got restless and decided I needed a Ph.D. in Philosophy. It
      was obvious.

      In graduate school, I learned to write my papers using
      <!-- <object

    /> -->

        id="latex"
        style="display: inline; position: relative; top: 6px"
      />. This was my first step into coding.
    </p>

    <p>
      After finishing the Ph.D., I was hired as a post-doc in Oxford. This was a
      lot of fun: no end of challenge and learning. I published a few papers and
      gave a few talks.

    <p>
      Then it was time to re-job. After being spoiled in Oxford, I was no longer
      willing to take temporary jobs. This is typically part of the entry price
      to the field, and entails moving across the country or around the world
      every year. I returned to teaching Latin.

    <p>
      I found more to learn in the new Latin job, and wonderful colleagues. But
      my learning again declined over time, and I miss having a challenge. I've
      been studying basic web development technologies for the past couple of
      years, and hope to change careers in 2022.
