    <h2>Teacher</h2>

    <p>
      I stumbled into a job as a high school Latin teacher. It turned out to be
      fun.

      After a few years I realized I wasn't learning as much as I had at the
      beginning. I got restless and decided I needed a Ph.D. in Philosophy. It
      was obvious.

    <p>
      I spent three years at the University of Oxford doing a post-doc. This
      spoiled me, among other things. When that was over, a job in philosophy no
      longer seemed so important. What other job was going to compare to Oxford?
      I returned to teaching Latin.

      I found more to learn in the new Latin job. But the learning has again
      declined over time, and I miss having a challenge. I've been studying
      basic web development technologies for the past couple of years, and I
      hope to change careers in 2022.
