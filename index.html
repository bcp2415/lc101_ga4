        <p>
          I stumbled into a job as a high school Latin teacher. It turned out to
          be fun.

          After a few years I wasn't learning as much as I had at the beginning.
          I got restless and decided I needed a Ph.D. in Philosophy. It was
          obvious.

      <h2>Philosopher</h2>

          In graduate school, I learned to write my papers using
          <img class="latex"
            src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/LaTeX_logo.svg"
            alt="LaTeX logo"
          />. This was my first step into coding.
        </p>

        <p>
          After finishing the Ph.D., I was hired as a post-doc in Oxford. This
          was a lot of fun: no end of challenge and learning. I published a few
          papers and gave a few talks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then it was time to re-job. After being spoiled in Oxford, I was no
          longer willing to take temporary jobs. This is typically part of the
          entry price to the field, and entails moving across the country or
          around the world every year. I returned to teaching Latin.

          I found more to learn in the new Latin job, and wonderful colleagues.
          But my learning again declined over time, and I miss having a
          challenge. I've been studying web development technologies for the
          past couple of years, and hope to change careers in 2022.

          Coding for the web combines several things I loved about philosophy:
        </p>

        <ul style="list-style-type: lower-greek">
          <li>Logic</li>
          <li>
            Typesetting:
            <img
              class="latex"
              src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/LaTeX_logo.svg"
              alt="LaTeX logo"
            />
            made it a pleasure to read what I was writing. Arranging elements on
            a surface to be attractive and so that information is easy to read
            is a great pleasure.

            Vim: I wrote my di&varsigma;&varsigma;ertation and research papers
            in &xvee;im. Among other things, it removes the enormous
            distractions of trying to watch a program do typesetting badly at
            the same time as one is trying to focus on the content one is
            writing.
