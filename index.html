    <h2>Teacher</h2>

    <p>
      I stumbled into a job as a high school Latin teacher. It turned out to be
      fun.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a few years I realized I wasn't learning as much as I had at the
      beginning. I got restless and decided I needed a Ph.D. in Philosophy. It
      was obvious.
    </p>

    <p>
      In graduate school, I learned to write my papers using
      <img

        alt="LaTeX logo"
        height="22em"
        id="latex"
        style="display: inline; position: relative; top: 6px"
      />. This was my first step into coding.
    </p>

    <p>
      After finishing the Ph.D., I was hired as a post-doc in Oxford. This was a
      lot of fun: no end of challenge and learning. I published a few papers and
      gave a few talks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then it was time to re-job. After being spoiled in Oxford, I was no longer
      willing to take temporary jobs. This is typically part of the entry price
      to the field, and entails moving across the country or around the world
      every year. I returned to teaching Latin.
    </p>

    <p>
      I found more to learn in the new Latin job, and wonderful colleagues. But
      my learning again declined over time, and I miss having a challenge. I've
      been studying web development technologies for the past couple of years,
      and hope to change careers in 2022.
    </p>

    <h2>Web Developer</h2>

    <p>Coding for the web combines several things I loved about philosophy:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Logic</li>
      <li>
        Typesetting:
        <img
          src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/LaTeX_logo.svg"
          alt="LaTeX logo"
          height="22em"
          id="latex"
          style="display: inline; position: relative; top: 6px"
        />
        made it a pleasure to read what I was writing. Arranging elements on a
        surface to be attractive and so that information is easy to read is a
        great pleasure.
      </li>
      <li>Git</li>
      <li>
        Vim: I wrote my dissertation and research papers in Vim. Among other
        things, it removes the enormous distractions of trying to watch a
        program do typesetting badly at the same time as one is trying to focus
        on the content one is writing.
